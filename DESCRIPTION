Title: Similarity Weighted Nonnegative Embedding: A method for visualizing high dimensional datasets
Version: 0.4.4
Author: Yan Wu
Maintainer: Yan Wu <yauwning@gmail.com>
Description: Uses matrix factorization to reduce high dimenensional dataset into factors, embeds factors
  in a 2D space for visualization, and then embeds samples and features relative to the factors,
  using a similarity matrix to ensure that samples which are close in the high dimensional space are also close 
  in the 2D visualization. The embedding of key features enhances interpretation of SWNE visualizations.

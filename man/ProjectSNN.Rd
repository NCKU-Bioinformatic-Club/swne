  test.data,
  train.data,
  n.pcs = NULL,
  features.use = NULL,
  k = 30,
  k.scale = 10,
  prune.SNN = 1/15,

}
\arguments{
\item{test.data}{Test data}

\item{train.data}{Training data}

\item{features.use}{Subset of features to use (default is all features)}

\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors}

\item{k.scale}{k*k.scale is the number of nearest neighbors to calculate shared nearest neighbors for}

\item{prune.SNN}{Minimum fraction of shared nearest neighbors}

\item{print.output}{Prints progress bar if true}

\item{pcs.use}{If not null, run PCA on training data and project test data before computing SNN}
}
